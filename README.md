# Password-Generator
The application saved in this repo generates a random password based on the criteria selected by the user.

# Notes
A function named IndexReserve was created to reserve one index for each criteria
entered by the user. This is to avoid missing selected criteria for shorter
passwords. This function uses a random value to select the reserved index and store them in an array of objects. The random value range is limited by the length of password specified.

The RandomCodeGenerate function performs the heavy lifting in this application because its tasks is to generate characters based on the selected criteria: lowecase,
uppercase, number, and/or special symbols. The characters are generated by interpreting randomly generated UTF-16 values corresponding to different characters. Concept of linear equation was adopted to clamp the random values to a range.

Finally, all the function are integrated in the generatePassword to generate a string containing the password.
